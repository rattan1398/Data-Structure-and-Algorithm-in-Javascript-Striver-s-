<h1 align="center"> Data Structure and Algorithm in Javascript Striver's</h1>
<h3 align="center">Hey everyone, This respository is created for the solutions of the Data structure and Algorithm questions picked up mostly from the Striver's Takes-uh-forward A2Z DSA Sheets and also the solutions of the Leetcode Questions in the Javascript programming language. All the DSA concepts based solutions, i will try to add as soon as I will solve them through Brute force approach to Better to Optimal approach. This will be my First detailed repository. To enter or take input from the user, use prompt In the terminal, initialise the npm init and install the prompt extension by using npm i prompt. Once this is done, while writing ur code use const prompt = require("prompt-sync")(); Concepts of the DSA that are included till now: 1. Patterns: There are 17 different patterns including Right traingle, Pyramids and many more... 2. All Sorting Techniques: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge and Quick.. 3. Array a. Easy Array Concepts b. Medium Array Concepts ChatGPT Data-Structure-and-Algorithm-in-Javascript-Striver-s- Hey everyone, This repository is created for the solutions of Data Structure and Algorithm questions, primarily sourced from Striver's Take-U-Forward A2Z DSA Sheets and LeetCode. All solutions are implemented in JavaScript. I aim to provide solutions from brute force to optimal approaches as I progress through the problems. This will be my first detailed repository. Getting Started Prerequisites To take input from the user, use the prompt-sync library. In the terminal, initialize the project with npm init and install the prompt-sync extension by running: bash Copy code npm i prompt-sync Once installed, you can use it in your code as follows: javascript Copy code const prompt = require("prompt-sync")(); Concepts Covered Patterns There are 17 different patterns, including right triangles, pyramids, and many more. Sorting Techniques Bubble Sort Insertion Sort Selection Sort Merge Sort Quick Sort Array Easy Array Concepts Medium Array Concepts How to Contribute Feel free to fork this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.
